# Receiver-Relayed-Meta-Transaction_-STYLE TOKEN
This setup involves both on-chain and off-chain components. The smart contract handles the on-chain execution, while the relayer script (with the receiver's wallet) manages the off-chain meta-transaction submission. By embedding the secret phrase within the relayer script, the receiver wallet can act as the relayer, reducing dependency on third-party services.
